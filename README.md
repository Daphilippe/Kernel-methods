# Objectif
Thanks to kernalisation it is possible to project data in a larger dimensional space in order to take advantage of linear tools.
The goal  is to present kernelization methods by making a comparison with primitive methods for PCA and Kmeans. Then we will use kernel trick to solve the one class SVDD algorithm and to do online learning.
